    <h2>What is a thread?</h2>
    <p>
      Consider the following problem: you're writing a web server, and you'd like to be able to handle requests from multiple clients
      at the same time. Using the standard features available in Java, you've written a simple prototype that accepts a request
      for a file, retrieves the file and responds to the client with the contents of the file. But how can you make it so
      that your program can accept a new request <em>while</em> the first request is still being processed?
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer is <em>threads</em>. A thread is a separate flow of program execution. With multiple threads, your program
      can (at least conceptually) do several things at the same time, such as accept a new client request while another client's
      file is being fetched.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are actually two types of threads in Java: <em>user threads</em> and <em>daemon threads</em>. When the last user
      thread has terminated, the JVM will exit. As a result, daemon threads are typically used for background processes (the
      JVM's garbage collector runs on a daemon thread). In the example problem, you might want to have your main thread accept
      requests and then pass them off to one of several user threads that are created for the purpose of fulfilling requests.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thread in Java is always in one of several states; the state of a thread can be retrieved using the <code>getState</code>      method
      on a
      <code>Thread</code> object. Here is a list of all the thread states (see also the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.State.html">official
        documentation</a>):
      <dl>
        <dt>NEW</dt>
        <dd>The thread has not yet started.</dd>
        <dt>RUNNABLE</dt>
        <dd>The thread is currently executing in the JVM.</dd>
        <dt>BLOCKED</dt>
        <dd>The thread is currently blocked, waiting for a monitor lock (that is, waiting to enter a synchronized block of
          code).
        </dd>
        <dt>WAITING</dt>
        <dd>The thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform some action. For example, the thread may have
          called the <code>wait</code> method on an object, which puts the thread in this state until another thread calls
          the <code>notify</code> method on the same object.</dd>
        <dt>TIMED_WAITING</dt>
        <dd>The thread is waiting for another thread to perform some action, as with the WAITING state, but with a timeout.
          That is, the thread will only wait for a certain amount of time before "giving up" and resuming execution.</dd>
        <dt>TERMINATED</dt>
        <dd>The thread has exited.</dd>
      </dl>
    </p>

    <h2>How do I use one?</h2>
    <p>
      There are two ways to make a thread in Java: you must either extend the
      <code>Thread</code> class or implement the <code>Runnable</code> interface. Let's give a simple example of both cases.
    </p>
    <a id="extending-thread"></a>
    <h3>Extending <code>Thread</code></h3>
    <p>
      When you extend the <code>Thread</code> class, you override the <code>run</code> method to implement your thread's
      behavior. Then, you call the <code>start</code> method on an object of your thread to start it.
    </p>
    <pre class="code-sample"><code class="java">public class ThreadExample {
    private static class MyThread extends Thread {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("I'm in another thread!");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t = new MyThread();
        t.start();
        // You will see the "I'm in another thread!" message.
    }
}</code></pre>

    <a id="implementing-runnable"></a>
    <h3>Implementing <code>Runnable</code></h3>
    <p>
      When you implement the <code>Runnable</code> interface, you must override the <code>run</code> method, where you implement
      your thread's behavior. Then, you construct a new <code>Thread</code> object, passing in an instance of your <code>Runnable</code>.
      The <code>start</code> method of that <code>Thread</code> object will start your thread.
    </p>
    <pre class="code-sample"><code class="java">public class RunnableExample {
    private static class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("I'm a Runnable!");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        t.start();
    }
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      Since <code>Runnable</code> is a functional interface (it has precisely one abstract method), you can use a lambda
      expression instead of writing out an entire class.
    </p>
    <pre class="code-sample"><code class="java">public class RunnableLambdaExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("I'm a Runnable inside a lambda expression!");
        });
        t.start();
    }
}</code></pre>

    <a id="caveats"></a>
    <h2>Is there anything I need to be careful of?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes, when you have several threads working with the same data. Consider what might happen if you have two threads both accessing
      and changing a counter, as in the example below.
    </p>
    <pre class="code-sample"><code class="java">public class ProblematicThreads {
    private static int counter = 0;

    private static class Counter implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            while (counter < 20) {
                int newCounterValue = counter + 1;
                System.out.println("Incrementing counter");
                counter = newCounterValue;
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new Counter());
        Thread t2 = new Thread(new Counter());
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      Let's say that as <code>t1</code> is printing <code>"Incrementing counter"</code>, <code>t2</code> calculates
      <code>newCounterValue</code>. Since <code>t1</code> hasn't updated <code>counter</code> yet, <code>t2</code> finds
      the same value for <code>newCounterValue</code> that <code>t1</code> found. But now, when each thread sets the new
      value for <code>counter</code>, this means that the new values will be the same; the counter was incremented only once,
      even though the message was output twice! This is probably not what the author of the above code wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      One solution is to <em>synchronize</em> access to <code>counter</code>. In Java, it is possible to use any object as
      a <em>lock</em> for a block of code marked with the <code>synchronized</code> keyword. The lock can only be held by
      one thread at a time, and only the thread that holds the lock may execute the code in the <code>synchronized</code>      block.
      Thus, we could rewrite the above example in a thread-safe way as follows.
    </p>
    <pre class="code-sample"><code class="java">public class UnproblematicThreads {
    private static int counter = 0;

    private static class Counter implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            while (true) {
                synchronized (UnproblematicThreads.class) {
                    if (counter >= 20) {
                        break;
                    }
                    int newCounterValue = counter + 1;
                    System.out.println("Incrementing counter");
                    counter = newCounterValue;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new Counter());
        Thread t2 = new Thread(new Counter());
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      Now, we know that the two threads will not be in conflict over the counter, since only one may be accessing it at any given
      time. Note that we also had to remove the loop condition and introduce an <code>if</code> statement inside the
      <code>synchronized</code> block; this is because we want <em>any</em> code accessing <code>counter</code> to be in
      the <code>synchronized</code> block, and wrapping the entire loop in the block would destroy any potential for concurrency
      (one thread would execute the entire loop, and the other thread would have nothing left to do).
